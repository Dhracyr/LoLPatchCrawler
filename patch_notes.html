        <h2>Changes for Akshan</h2>
        <a href="https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/champions/akshan/">
            <img src="https://am-a.akamaihd.net/image?f=http://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/14.8.1/img/champion/Akshan.png" alt="Akshan">
        </a>
        <h3>Summary of Changes</h3>
        <p>Q movement speed on champion hit no longer scales with level, damage to non-champions decreased. R minimum damage per shot increased, maximum damage adjusted.</p>
        <h3>Developer Commentary</h3>
        <blockquote>Akshan has long had two problems: First, he’s been a fairly frustrating top and mid laner to face, staying just out of reach from his melee opposition while also having incredible roam power. Second, his baseline reliability is quite low, making him incredibly hard to approach in lower-skilled play. We expect Akshan to require a lot of practice to get the most out of him, but we think we can still bring up his baseline. Due to how fair his R is (minions and turrets can block shots, in addition to champions), we think this ability could use some strong buffs that won't compromise the ability’s counter-play. These R buffs should result in up to 50% more ultimate damage in the most extreme cases late-game, but will typically be closer to 10% against low-health opponents.</blockquote>

        </a>
        <h3>Summary of Changes</h3>
        <p>Passive bonus attack speed adjusted, Q damage decreased, Q damage to monsters increased early game.</p>
        <h3>Developer Commentary</h3>
        <blockquote>Bel’Veth has continued to terrorize the jungle in higher levels of play, so we’re taking a decent-sized swing at her PVP combat power in this patch. As compensation for lower-skilled play, we’re making her jungle a little more forgiving by buffing her early game monster damage. This monster damage buff then becomes a nerf at about 65 bonus AD while her PVP damage is always lower which should result in the high skill skewed nerf that the Void Empress needs.</blockquote>

        </a>
        <h3>Summary of Changes</h3>
        <p>E damage range indicator added. R animation added, can now cast while moving.</p>
        <h3>Developer Commentary</h3>
        <blockquote>Kennen’s a pretty sad yordle in his current state, and that’s Amumu’s job. We’re giving Kennen a meaningful buff by way of making his kit more synergistic with itself. This fast-moving, zapping ninja no longer stands in place when powering up Slicing Maelstrom. We’re turning this anti-synergy with Lightning Rush into a positive one, allowing him to more quickly reach his targets. He’s also got a brand new animation for powering up his R to match the new cast paradigm!</blockquote>

        </a>
        <h3>Summary of Changes</h3>
        <p>Q minimum damage decreased, bonus attack speed increased, bonus damage based on critical strike chance decreased.</p>
        <h3>Developer Commentary</h3>
        <blockquote>Back in 13.22, we nerfed Nilah’s attack speed from Q, which ended up nerfing her more in high level play. We’re reverting that nerf and nudging her gameplay toward consistent DPS as opposed to burst damage, so we’re returning that attack speed and instead reducing some up-front burst damage on her active instead. Nilah is a bit stronger than where we think she should be, so our intent for these changes to leave Nilah a bit weaker than she currently is, especially in lower-skilled play.</blockquote>

     boaring
    
    . Now that we won’t see Pro play for a few patches, we’re rushing to her aid. We’re trying to give her a mix of added damage and durability that strongly scales with her gold income, as pro junglers tend to get much less gold than the rest of us.</blockquote>

        </a>
        <h3>Summary of Changes</h3>
        <p>Mana regen growth increased. Q damage decreased, buff no longer refreshed when hitting wards/plants. W slow decreased.</p>
        <h3>Developer Commentary</h3>
        <blockquote>Skarner is currently very overpowered, especially in elite play, where he’s making the Rift AND enemy’s boots quake. His potent early game often ends games before other champions can reach their power spikes which is why we’re going after his early game. We’ll be doing this by taking down a mix of his early damage and his sticking power with his Q and W. The mana regen line is here to give him a bit of compensation in top lane, as he’s currently a much stronger jungler than top laner and players are clearly happy to play him in both roles.</blockquote>
